# InstagramKiller 📸

InstagramKiller is an Instagram-like app built using **UIKit**. It replicates key features of Instagram, such as viewing posts, liking photos, sharing images, searching for users, and editing profiles. The app also includes a notifications system and a discover page.

## Features 🛠️

- **Feed** 📰: Displays posts with captions, images, likes, and comments.
- **Search** 🔍: Users can search for other users or posts.

- **Notifications** 🔔: Displays like and comment notifications categorized by time (New, Today, This Week, This Month).
- **Discover Page** 🌍: Allows users to explore content and users via a search bar and collection view.

## Technology Stack ⚙️

- **UIKit**: The app is built entirely using UIKit for the user interface.
- **Mockoon**: Mock API for fetching posts, images, and notifications.

## How it Works ⚡

- The app interacts with a local **Mockoon** API to fetch posts, user data, and notifications.
- **Posts** 📸: Includes user details (profile picture, username, caption, likes, comments).
- **User Profiles** 👤: Displays user information such as name, description, and stats (followers, following).
- **Notifications** 🔔: Organized into categories like "New", "Today", "This Week", "This Month".
- **Data Fetching** 📥: Posts and notifications are fetched asynchronously and displayed in UITableViews or UICollectionViews.

## UI Components 🖥️

- **HomePage** 🏠: Displays posts in a table view with dynamic content.
- **DiscoverPage** 🔍: Allows users to search for content and users, with results displayed in a collection view.
